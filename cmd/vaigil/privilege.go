// What every command needs before it is allowed to run.
//
// This exists because the check was in one place and needed to be in twenty.
// `publish` called authorise and nothing else did, so with a policy configured
// and no token presented at all:
//
//	auth grant mallory admin              succeeded
//	auth revoke alice admin               succeeded
//	token issue evil --role admin         succeeded, and printed a live token
//	schedule add 1h                       succeeded, deferring a publish
//
// which is the entire access-control model bypassed by anyone able to run the
// binary. publish refused correctly the whole time, and that inconsistency is
// what shows it was an omission rather than a decision: if the reasoning had
// been "filesystem access to the store is already game over", publish would
// not have been checking either.
//
// It is not game over, and the rest of this program is built on that. The
// audit log is written by a separate account precisely so that code execution
// as Vaigil is not enough to rewrite it, and a store on a shared volume is a
// normal deployment.
//
// So the table, rather than a call at the top of each command. A call has to
// be remembered; a table is a list somebody has to add a row to, and the test
// below refuses to pass until every dispatched command has one. This is the
// same shape as the content-type gate test, which is what caught the HTTP API
// writing content without validating it.

// Which page a command is about, so that a binding scoped to part of the site
// means something on the command line.
//
// # What was wrong
//
// This used to be one line returning "/" for everything, and its comment
// called that coarse by design: "the finer per-page checks stay where the page
// name is known". There were no finer per-page checks. Every authorise() call
// on this surface passes "/", so the coarse gate was the only gate, and being
// coarse had two consequences that are not the same shape.
//
// A grant narrowed with --on /blog stopped working altogether. covers("/blog",
// "/") is false, so an author scoped to part of the site could run no command
// at all, and the flag the help text calls "enforced" was a way to lock
// somebody out. That is the wrong answer, but it is the safe wrong answer.
//
// A deny narrowed the same way stopped working too, and that one is a hole. A
// publisher denied on /legal still holds publisher on "/"; the deny does not
// cover "/"; the target was always "/". So the deny never matched, and
// `vaigil section set legal/notice 0 body=…` was permitted by the very policy
// written to forbid it. The browser interface enforced it and the command line
// did not, which is worse than not having the feature at all: somebody reads
// the policy, sees the deny, and believes it.
//
// # Why a table, and why it is allowed to give up
//
// The page has to be identified before the command parses its own arguments,
// which is the awkward part — at this point `args` is just words. Most
// commands make that easy by taking their positional arguments first and
// finding them with leadingArgs, which stops at the first flag. Those get a
// row here naming which positional is the page, read with leadingArgs itself,
// so the gate and the command cannot disagree about which word they are
// looking at.
//
// Anything not in the table, and anything in it whose page argument is missing
// or is not a name this can be sure of, falls back to "/". That is the strict
// direction: "/" is covered only by a binding on the whole site, so a command
// this cannot read is authorised as though it touched everything. A new
// command therefore arrives over-guarded, which is a bug report, rather than
// under-guarded, which is a breach.
//
// The corollary is the one thing that must not be got wrong: a row here is a
// claim that the command touches *that page and nothing else*. A row for a
// command that also writes somewhere else would narrow the check away from the
// place it was needed.
