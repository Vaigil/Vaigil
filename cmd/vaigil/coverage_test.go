// Every capability has to be reachable from the interface people actually use.
//
// This exists because the gap got large without anybody noticing: thirty-nine

// over MCP. Each feature was built, tested and shipped correctly — on one
// surface — and "the GUI comes later" turned out to mean it did not come.
//
// The table below is the answer, and the point is that it is a table. A gap
// with a written reason is a decision; a gap with nothing next to it is an
// oversight, and this test cannot tell them apart unless somebody writes the
// reason down. Adding a command means adding a row, and the row is where you
// notice you have built something nobody can see.

	"vuln": {GUI: "/security/vulns", MCP: []string{"vuln_plan"},

	"workforce": {
		Why: "it reads an export and reports what the join could and could " +
			"not do; the screen arrives with the connectors that produce " +
			"those exports on a schedule, rather than with the join",
		NoMCP: "a model that can merge two people can merge the auditor " +
			"into the intern; Link.Validate refuses an AI assertion, and a " +
			"tool that could only propose would be a tool whose one useful " +
			"call is the one it may not make",
	},

	// The contact list, the notices and what was delivered.
	"notify": {
		Why: "the contact list is personal data and the suppression list " +
			"is a list of people who asked to be left alone; neither goes " +
			"in the store a web process serves, so the screen arrives with " +
			"the customer-facing inbox rather than with the operator's side",
		NoMCP: "a notice is the organisation speaking to its customers and " +
			"to a regulator, and Notice.Validate refuses an AI author for " +
			"that reason; a model may draft one and a person sends it",

	// Stacking over a file somebody exported, at the point where they are

	"detect": {GUI: "/security/detections", MCP: []string{"detection_stats"},
