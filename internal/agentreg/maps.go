// The recorder-host to agent mapping: which registered agents an operator
// says run on which recorder host. It is what the watch-then-call chain was
// refused for wanting (the end-of-file comment in the pack's correlations),
// and it is deliberately a declaration rather than an inference — the
// collector's evidence says a file changed on a host and never who changed
// it, and no program in the middle of that can close the gap. An operator
// who runs the estate can, by saying "build01 runs watcher", and that is
// what this file holds: their word, on the record, changeable.
//
// A sibling file to agents.json rather than rows inside it, because the
// registry is the IA-9 review object — who exists, who owns each one, what
// each may call — and a host column is not about who may act but about
// where evidence comes from. Folding it in would make every review of the
// register read past a field no gate consults, and would tie the register's
// tests to a shape that changes on a different cadence: agents are
// registered once and reviewed quarterly, hosts are mapped as recorders are
// onboarded. The discipline is the registry's own either way — one JSON
// document, changed whole under its lock, absent means empty, unreadable
// means refused.

// MaxAgentsPerHost caps how many registered agents one host may be declared
// to run. Four, because a shared CI box is a fact — a build runner with a
// watcher and a triage bot and a docs generator on it is a machine somebody
// can describe in one sentence — and an unbounded mapping is not a
// description but an inference nobody wrote: a host "running" forty agents
// is a host where somebody mapped a fleet instead of saying which machines
// it lives on. Refused past the cap rather than warned, so the mapping stays
// the length of a sentence somebody would actually say out loud.

// maxHostLen is the length of a host name this will hold. DNS caps one at
// 253 octets, and a host string longer than that is not a host name any
// recorder will report, so it is a paste that went wrong.

// validHost says whether s could be a recorder host: one token, no
// whitespace, no control characters, and no longer than a host name is.
