// Proving a detection rule.
//
// The claim: this rule fires on every event in the corpus that is labelled
// as its own, and on nothing else it reads. The checks, in order, each one
// stopping the next only where running it would mean nothing:
//
//  1. valid    — the rule passes detect.Rule.Validate. An invalid rule is
//     refuted here and nothing else is run against it.
//  2. fixtures — its own must-match and must-not-match examples hold. These
//     are the author's, so passing them is necessary and never enough.
//  3. corpus   — replayed over a labelled corpus the author did not write:
//     every entry expecting it caught, nothing else fired on, including
//     false positives somebody already recorded and nobody has fixed.
//
// The verdict is inconclusive when nothing failed but the corpus could not
// have failed the rule: no entry expecting it, or no entry from a source
// it reads expecting quiet. Evidence that cannot contradict a claim does
// not confirm it.

// DetectionVerifier and DetectionVerifierVersion name this verifier in
// every proof it makes. The version moves when what a check does changes.
