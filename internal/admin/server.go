// Package admin serves the editing interface.
//
// # Why this is server-rendered HTML
//
// ATAG 2.0 says the plain thing out loud: a web-based authoring tool "may rely
// on user agent features such as keyboard navigation, find functions, display
// preferences, and undo features" to meet its criteria. A form-and-links admin
// inherits all of that from the browser, correctly, for nothing. A single-page
// app reimplements each one and usually gets at least one wrong — focus after
// navigation, the back button, find-in-page across virtualised lists.
//
// The other reasons point the same way. vaigil is one static binary in a
// scratch image with no dependencies; adding a JavaScript build would bring a
// node toolchain, several hundred transitive packages, and a bundle larger than
// the entire program. For a security console, shipping a framework to render
// a form would be an odd thing to do.
//
// So: HTML over HTTP, forms that work with scripting disabled, and no build
// step. Progressive enhancement, not degradation.
//
// # Accessibility is structural here
//
// The console must be usable by a disabled analyst, which is the half that
// gets skipped because the people who build admin panels are rarely the
// people locked out of them.
//
// Concretely, and each of these is a thing that is normally wrong:
//
//   - Every control is a real button or link, so it is reachable and operable by
//     keyboard without a single line of script.
//   - Focus is always visible, at 3:1 contrast and a 2px perimeter (WCAG 2.2
//     2.4.13), and never hidden behind a sticky bar (2.4.11).
//   - No action requires dragging (2.5.7). Reordering is a number you type,
//     which is also faster.
//   - Targets are at least 24x24 CSS pixels (2.5.8).
//   - Authentication is pasting a token. No puzzle, no image recognition, no
//     transcription — those are cognitive function tests and 3.3.8 prohibits
//     them.
//   - Status messages announce themselves without stealing focus.
//   - Colour never carries meaning alone; every state has a word.
//
// # Preview
//
// A.3.7.1 wants a preview rendered by a real in-market user agent rather than an
// approximation. So preview serves the actual page to the actual browser instead
// of drawing a picture of it in a panel.
