// It was markup — nineteen list items written out twice, once per orientation
// — and markup cannot answer the three questions now being asked of it: what
// order does this person want their tabs in, which of them may this person
// actually use, and where in the documentation is the page they are looking
// at explained.
//
// So it is a table. The table is the single place a destination exists: adding
// a screen means adding a row, and the row carries its group, the permission
// it needs, and its documentation anchor. Three tests read it — one checks
// every path is served, one checks every anchor exists in the documentation,
// and one checks nothing is in the mux that is not either here or written
// down as deliberately absent.

// destination is one place a person can go.
