// The Agents board: what the agents in this estate have been doing, from the
// two places aertun already hears them.
//
// Everything counted here is observed telemetry, read from the spool on
// request the way Events and Hunt read it: aertun/agent — the sidecar's tool
// calls and the analyst's proposals, with the agent as the actor under the
// audit log's pseudonym — and otel/genai — GenAI spans pushed over OTLP, with
// the agent identity the SDK set as the actor. A row exists because an event
// named it, and never otherwise.
//
// The two sources name agents differently, and the difference is kept rather
// than resolved. The actor key is one join; the registry (internal/agentreg)
// is the other, and it runs one way only. A row's own events carry clear
// names — the token's name in raw.client, which for a registered agent is
// agent:NAME, and sometimes an agent field — and where such a name names a
// registry entry, the row can say what the registry holds about it: the
// owner, the tools it may call, the status. Never the other way round: the
// registry cannot put a row on this board, because the board is what
// happened and the registry is what was declared. A registered agent no
// event has named is a fact the header states as a count, with the words
// that silence is not absence — not a row standing on events that do not
// exist. Guessing a join the events do not carry would put one agent's
// refusals on another agent's record, which is the one wrong answer a
// security screen must not give.
//
// An agent's page also groups its window into sessions: every otel/genai
// event that carried one trace id, laid out as a timeline a finding's
// evidence can cite. The trace id is the events' own edge and the only one
// grouped on — aertun/agent events carry no trace id, so they stay one
// chronological stream, said as that rather than fenced into sessions
// nobody observed the edges of. The one annotation the timelines add is
// arithmetic over the same window: a tool the agent had not used in it
// before is marked at its first use, an observation and never a verdict,
// and nothing is marked about the data itself, because no event here
// carries a sensitivity label to mark it with.
//
// Nothing here is written anywhere. It is a view, assembled per request
// inside the same byte budget the other spool screens hold themselves to.

// AgentRegistry is the registry of agents this organisation runs
// (internal/agentreg): who owns each agent, what it may call, whether it is
// still allowed to act. The host sets it when it starts the console beside
// the registry file; unset, it is a registry holding nobody, which is the
// same answer an absent registry file gives and the one the enforcement
