// The purple loop: the closed half of the wind tunnel, where a miss becomes
// a proposal instead of a number.
//
// A run attests what the controls caught and what they did not. The
// scorecard is where a conventional BAS product stops — a heatmap, a miss
// rate, an invoice for more content. This package can go one step further
// and stay honest about it, because the miss is not an abstraction here: the
// run spliced the session's exact events into a scratch spool, replayed the
// reference pack over them, and recorded which expectation went unmet. The
// raw material of a detection — the attack's own telemetry, and the benign
// twin's — is evidence the scorecard can name by digest.
//
// So the loop drafts. From a miss whose events the telemetry carried — a
// content miss, or a session nothing alerted on — it derives a candidate
// rule by deterministic code: the narrowest predicate tree over a closed
// vocabulary of fields that matches the session's separable events and
// refuses every event of its benign twin. The must-match fixtures are the
// scenario's own events; the must-not-match fixtures are the twin's. That is
// exactly the discipline the pack's authors apply by hand to every rule in
// internal/detect/pack — the loop automates it honestly, or refuses.
//
// # What the loop refuses, by name
//
// A miss whose events are identical to the twin's on every closed field is a
// gap to declare, not a rule to force: the slopsquat session's install and
// its twin's differ only in a package name nobody vetted, and the
// recorder-blind session's darkness is an absence no event carries. Forcing
// a rule over either would be a detection quoting free text — the thing the
// suppression discipline refuses elsewhere (internal/detect/tuning.go:
// whoever is being detected can put any word in raw.*), refused here before
// the rule exists. A lateness miss is refused because it is a finding about
// the watermark budget, not about the rules. A draft that fires on the base
// stream above a small threshold is refused with its count, because a rule
// that fires on the estate it watches is noise wearing a detection's name.
//
// # Propose, never deploy
//
// A draft lands as a proposal file in the pack's own rule format plus an
// audit record with the closed details. Promoting it is a human act through
// the ring machinery — the file into the pack, on the record. The loop never
// writes the pack, for the same reason tuning.Propose changes nothing
// itself: a detector that edits its own controls can be talked out of the
// one that would have caught it.

// of every schema here: fields change meaning between versions, and a record
// from another schema is refused rather than best-effort loaded.
