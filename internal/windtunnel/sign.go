// Signing a scorecard, twice, with algorithms that fail differently.
//
// This is internal/pack's signing discipline (internal/pack/sign.go), which
// is internal/audit's, applied to a third domain. Ed25519 because it is the
// algorithm everything else here uses; ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) because it is
// the post-quantum half, standardised and in the standard library. Both
// signatures are made and both are required — no AcceptSingle shape exists
// anywhere in this codebase, and a verifier that could be talked into one
// signature is the property an attacker buys a key for.
//
// The key material is the content plane's, reused: the same dual key a
// store's keygen made, the same seeds-on-disk format, the same release key
// the operator already holds. The context below is new and versioned, so a
// scorecard signature can never be re-presented as a pack signature or an
// audit head — a signature made for one purpose must never be presentable
// as one for another, and the separation lives in the signed bytes
// themselves.

// ScorecardContext is the domain every windtunnel-scorecard signature is
// made and checked in. Versioned, so a change to what gets signed cannot be
// confused with the thing it replaced.
