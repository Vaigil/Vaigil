// The scenario: a malicious agent session as the SOC would see it, declared
// as data (decision 1).
//
// The shape borrows from the formalisms that earned it and refuses the rest.
// From Atomic Red Team: typed bindings with defaults and a prereq split —
// preflight checks the base stream can host the session before anything is
// spliced, and a failed preflight refuses the run rather than splicing an
// event no rule can read. From Caldera: the fact system's shape — a step may
// bind a generated value later steps reference, giving one coherent session
// rather than independent events — implemented as a closed substitution
// table, not a parser over command strings. From Sigma: the discipline that
// a scenario, like a rule, describes what to look for and never what to do,
// and `falsepositives` as a first-class field, which is what the benign twin
// is. The executor — Atomic's shell, Caldera's command — is refused entirely:
