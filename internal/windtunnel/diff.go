// The regression diff: two sealed scorecards in, the transitions between
// them out, and an exit code a CI job can gate on — the documents are
// self-contained, so no store and no history exist to consult (decision
// 10's payoff).
//
// # The grammar
//
// Per scenario, the outcome transition is read as one of three words:
//
//   - regression — anything → missed. The controls that caught it no
//     longer do, whatever they were doing before.
//   - fix — missed → anything. The other direction, named for what it is.
//   - drift — any other change of tier (caught-alert → caught-telemetry
//     and friends): reported, named, never gated on. A gate that failed on
//     every movement would be a gate nobody enables.
//
// The twin axis is its own transition: quiet → false-fire is a regression
// (the precision axis failed; every catch above it is noise until the twin
// is quiet again), false-fire → quiet is a fix. Scenarios that ran in only
// one document are new or retired, reported so a diff over a subset run
// cannot pretend it compared the whole corpus. The aggregate carries both
// sides' miss rates with their Wilson bounds, and the ambient drift is
// told apart from rule findings: if the base stream's own alerts moved,
// the estate moved, and no transition in that diff is a fact about the
// rules alone.
//
// # What refuses to diff at all
//
// Documents from different engines, different scoring modes or different
// corpora are refused: a scorecard's numbers are only comparable against
// the engine that produced them, and modes are never pooled — a reference
// card and a their-Sigma card measure different subjects and a transition
// between them would be a fact about the join, not about the controls.
//
// # Determinism
//
// Everything is sorted — scenarios by id, everything else in declaration
// order — and nothing reads a clock, so the same two files diff to the
// same bytes every time, which is what makes a CI diff over two diff runs
// mean anything.
