// The technique heatmap: the coverage grid every breach-and-attack
// product renders, in the aertun tradition — categorical words from
// twin-scored scenarios, never a vendor percentage, and never a colour a
// reader has to perceive.
//
// # The accessibility decision, made here and stated on the render
//
// The research asked for a colour-blind-safe ramp with the count printed
// in every cell, and for the one case where the palette cannot promise
// redundancy: the text grid alone. A terminal is exactly that case. This
// program's writer colours its output only when stdout is a terminal, and
// it has no way to know which of the sixteen colours it asks for arrive
// on the other end — a reader's theme, a monochrome display, a pipe and a
// pager all change the answer, and a grid whose meaning survives none of
// those is hue-only encoding with extra steps. So the heatmap ships as
// words: every cell carries its outcome word, every row carries its
// counts, and the render says so in as many words. The five outcomes are
// distinguishable as text by construction; nothing in the grid is
// perceivable only by colour, and a screen reader reads the same grid a
// founder scans.
//
// # Why counts live in the margins
//
// A cell is one technique in one scenario, and a scenario stages a
// technique once, so a per-cell count would be a permanent 1 — noise
// wearing a number's clothes. The honest counts are the row margins: how
// many scenarios stage this technique, and at which tiers they landed.
// They are printed at the end of every row and sealed into the document
// beside the cells they summarise.

// HeatNA is the cell for a technique a scenario does not stage: a word,
// like the other five, and not a blank — a blank is indistinguishable
// from a rendering gap, and "na" says what it is.
