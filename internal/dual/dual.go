// Package dual keeps the privileged changes that wait for a second
// administrator (NIST SP 800-53 AC-5, CM-5(4) and AU-9(5): dual
// authorisation).
//
// Making somebody an administrator, issuing an administrator's token,
// weakening a setting, lowering how many approvals a change needs and
// moving the audit log are each something one person, or whoever has their
// session, could do to take a store over or to hide that they had. So one
// administrator proposes and another approves, and the request records
// both.
//
// A store with one administrator is not left unable to change anything,
// and is not left open to whoever holds that administrator's session
// either. Their own request waits — an hour, a day to move the audit log —
// announced in the audit log, where the self-watch rules raise it at once;
// anybody with a session may decline it while it waits, and declining
// always wins. Only after the delay may they approve it themselves, and
// the record says it was approved alone. A stolen session can start a
// takeover; it cannot finish one before somebody has had the chance to
// notice. This is the solo half of NIST SP 800-53 AC-5: separation of
// duties held in time when it cannot be held between people.
//
// The store keeps the request, not the change: what applying a request
// does is its caller's, by kind, because the changes live in different
// parts of the program.
