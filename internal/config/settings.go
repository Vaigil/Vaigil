// Every setting, in one table.
//
// A table rather than scattered constants for the same reason the privilege
// table is one: a knob nobody can find is a knob nobody can audit, and
// `vaigil config list` has to be able to print all of them. Adding a setting
// anywhere else in the program is a setting that does not appear here, and a
// test refuses that.
//
// The Weaker functions are the interesting column. They are not "is this
// number bigger" — weaker is not always a direction. A longer token life is
// weaker because a stolen credential lasts longer. A longer lockout is also
// weaker, in the other direction, because it hands an attacker a way to lock
// real users out by failing their logins for them. Both are written out.
