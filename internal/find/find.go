//
// # Why it is not a query language
//
// There is no syntax here — no fields, no operators, no negation, no
// comparison. The input is tokenised into words and the words are looked
// up; a colon, a quote or a bracket is a character in a word and means
// nothing. A query language is the thing that eventually gets an injection.
